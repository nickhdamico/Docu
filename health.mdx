## Overview

The Roxom API provides health check endpoints to monitor system availability and performance. Use these endpoints to verify connectivity and check the operational status of various services.

## Basic Health Check

### Endpoint
```http
GET /health
```

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.roxom.com/health" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.roxom.com/health')
health_data = response.json()
print(f"Status: {health_data['status']}")
```

```javascript JavaScript
fetch('https://api.roxom.com/health')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Status:', data.status));
```
</CodeGroup>

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "uptime": "7d 14h 23m"
}
```

## Detailed Health Check

For authenticated users, detailed health information is available:

### Endpoint
```http
GET /health/detailed
```

<Note>
  This endpoint requires authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization header.
</Note>

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.roxom.com/health/detailed" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "uptime": "7d 14h 23m",
  "services": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "response_time": "2ms"
    },
    "market_data": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "response_time": "5ms",
      "last_update": "2024-01-15T10:29:58Z"
    },
    "order_matching": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "response_time": "1ms",
      "queue_size": 42
    },
    "websocket": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "active_connections": 1547
    }
  },
  "metrics": {
    "requests_per_second": 1250,
    "average_response_time": "15ms",
    "error_rate": "0.02%"
  }
}
```

## Status Codes

The health check endpoints return different HTTP status codes based on system health:

| Status Code | System State | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `200` | Healthy | All systems operational |
| `503` | Degraded | Some services experiencing issues |
| `500` | Unhealthy | Critical systems down |

## Service Status Values

Individual services can report the following status values:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `healthy` | Service is fully operational |
| `degraded` | Service is operational but experiencing performance issues |
| `unhealthy` | Service is not responding or experiencing critical issues |
| `maintenance` | Service is temporarily unavailable for maintenance |

## Monitoring Integration

### Prometheus Metrics

Health metrics are exposed in Prometheus format:

```http
GET /metrics
```

### Example Monitoring Script

```python
import requests
import time
import logging

def monitor_roxom_health():
    """Monitor Roxom API health and log any issues."""
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(
            'https://api.roxom.com/health/detailed',
            headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'},
            timeout=10
        )
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            health_data = response.json()
            
            # Check overall status
            if health_data['status'] != 'healthy':
                logging.warning(f"API status: {health_data['status']}")
            
            # Check individual services
            for service, details in health_data.get('services', {}).items():
                if details['status'] != 'healthy':
                    logging.warning(f"Service {service} status: {details['status']}")
                    
        else:
            logging.error(f"Health check failed: HTTP {response.status_code}")
            
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Health check request failed: {e}")

# Run every 30 seconds
while True:
    monitor_roxom_health()
    time.sleep(30)
```

### Uptime Monitoring

Set up automated monitoring using services like:

- **Pingdom**: Monitor endpoint availability
- **DataDog**: Comprehensive API monitoring
- **New Relic**: Performance monitoring
- **Custom solutions**: Using the health endpoints

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Timeouts">
    If you're experiencing connection timeouts:
    
    1. Check your network connectivity
    2. Verify you're using the correct regional endpoint
    3. Try the global endpoint: `https://api.roxom.com`
    4. Contact support if issues persist
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="503 Service Unavailable">
    When receiving 503 responses:
    
    1. Check the detailed health endpoint for specific service status
    2. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic
    3. Monitor our status page for ongoing incidents
    4. Consider using multiple regional endpoints for redundancy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors on /health/detailed">
    If you can't access detailed health information:
    
    1. Verify your API key is valid and not expired
    2. Ensure you have the correct permissions
    3. Check that you're including the Authorization header
    4. Contact support to verify your API key permissions
  </Accordion>
