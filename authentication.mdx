## Overview

All Roxom API endpoints require authentication using API keys. You must include your API key in the request headers to access any protected resources.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Getting API Keys

API keys are provided by the Roxom team. To request access:

1. Contact our support team at [support@roxom.io](mailto:support@roxom.io)
2. Provide details about your intended use case
3. Our team will review your request and provide API credentials

## Authentication Method

Roxom uses **Bearer Token** authentication. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

### Request Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.roxom.io/account" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.roxom.io/account', headers=headers)
```

```javascript
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

fetch('https://api.roxom.io/account', { headers })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you will receive one of the following error responses:

### Missing Authorization Header

```json
{
  "error": 401,
  "message": "Authorization header is required"
}
```

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "error": 401,
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

### Expired API Key

```json
{
  "error": 401,
  "message": "API key has expired"
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Store API Keys Securely">
    - Use environment variables to store API keys
    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Use different API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle Authentication Errors">
    - Implement proper error handling for 401 responses
    - Log authentication failures for debugging
    - Have a strategy for API key rotation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
    - Be aware of rate limits associated with your API key
    - Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
    - Monitor your API usage to avoid hitting limits
  </Accordion>
