## Order Types Overview

Roxom supports four main order types, each designed for different trading strategies and market conditions.

## Market Orders

Execute immediately at the current market price.

### Characteristics
- **Execution**: Immediate (fills against existing orders in the order book)
- **Price**: Not specified (takes the best available price)
- **Guarantee**: Execution is guaranteed (if sufficient liquidity exists)
- **Priority**: Highest execution priority

### When to Use
- **Immediate execution** is more important than price
- **High liquidity** markets where slippage is minimal
- **Emergency exits** from positions
- **Small order sizes** relative to market depth

### Example
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USD",
  "side": "BUY",
  "type": "MARKET",
  "quantity": "0.01000000"
}
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Market Order Execution">
    **For BUY market orders:**
    1. Matches against the lowest ask prices first
    2. Continues up the ask side until filled
    3. May execute at multiple price levels for large orders
    
    **For SELL market orders:**
    1. Matches against the highest bid prices first
    2. Continues down the bid side until filled
    3. May execute at multiple price levels for large orders
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slippage Considerations">
    **Price Impact**: Large market orders may move the market price
    
    **Slippage Protection**: Consider using limit orders for large sizes
    
    **Market Depth**: Check order book depth before placing large market orders
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limit Orders

Execute only at a specified price or better.

### Characteristics
- **Execution**: Only at the specified price or better
- **Price**: User-specified limit price
- **Guarantee**: Price is guaranteed, execution is not
- **Priority**: Price-time priority in the order book

### When to Use
- **Price control** is important
- **Patient trading** where timing is flexible
- **Market making** strategies
- **Large orders** to minimize market impact

### Example
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USD",
  "side": "BUY",
  "type": "LIMIT",
  "quantity": "0.01000000",
  "price": "45000.00000000",
  "time_in_force": "GTC"
}
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Limit Order Behavior">
    **BUY Limit Orders:**
    - Will only execute at the limit price or lower
    - Becomes a maker order if price is below current market
    - Becomes a taker order if price matches existing asks
    
    **SELL Limit Orders:**
    - Will only execute at the limit price or higher  
    - Becomes a maker order if price is above current market
    - Becomes a taker order if price matches existing bids
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Time in Force Options">
    **GTC (Good Till Canceled)**: Remains active until filled or manually canceled
    
    **IOC (Immediate or Cancel)**: Executes immediately for the available quantity, cancels remainder
    
    **FOK (Fill or Kill)**: Executes completely or cancels entirely
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Stop Orders

Market orders triggered when a stop price is reached.

### Characteristics
- **Execution**: Becomes a market order when stop price is hit
- **Price**: Stop price triggers the order
- **Use Case**: Risk management and momentum trading
- **Direction**: Stop price is typically worse than current market

### When to Use
- **Stop losses** to limit downside risk
- **Breakout trading** when price moves beyond resistance/support
- **Risk management** for existing positions
- **Automated exits** based on price movement

### Example
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USD",
  "side": "SELL",
  "type": "STOP",
  "quantity": "0.01000000",
  "stop_price": "44000.00000000"
}
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stop Order Triggers">
    **For SELL Stop Orders (Stop Loss):**
    - Triggers when market price ≤ stop price
    - Common for closing long positions
    - Protects against downward price movement
    
    **For BUY Stop Orders (Stop Buy):**
    - Triggers when market price ≥ stop price
    - Common for closing short positions or breakout trading
    - Protects against upward price movement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Important Considerations">
    **No Price Guarantee**: Once triggered, executes as market order
    
    **Gap Risk**: May execute at prices far from stop price during gaps
    
    **Trigger Method**: Uses last trade price for trigger determination
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Stop-Limit Orders

Limit orders triggered when a stop price is reached.

### Characteristics
- **Execution**: Becomes a limit order when stop price is hit
- **Price**: Both stop price (trigger) and limit price (execution)
- **Control**: Combines stop trigger with price protection
- **Risk**: May not execute if market gaps past limit price

### When to Use
- **Price protection** with stop functionality
- **Controlled exits** where execution price matters
- **Risk management** with price limits
- **Volatile markets** where gaps are common

### Example
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USD",
  "side": "SELL",
  "type": "STOP_LIMIT",
  "quantity": "0.01000000",
  "stop_price": "44000.00000000",
  "price": "43900.00000000"
}
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stop-Limit Mechanics">
    **Two-Step Process:**
    1. **Trigger Phase**: Monitors market price vs stop price
    2. **Execution Phase**: Places limit order when triggered
    
    **Price Relationship:**
    - Stop price determines when order activates
    - Limit price determines execution constraints
    - Limit price should be more aggressive than stop price
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Execution Scenarios">
    **Normal Execution**: Stop triggers, limit order fills normally
    
    **Partial Fill**: Stop triggers, limit order partially fills
    
    **No Fill**: Stop triggers, but market gaps past limit price
    
    **Queue Position**: Limit order joins order book queue when triggered
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
