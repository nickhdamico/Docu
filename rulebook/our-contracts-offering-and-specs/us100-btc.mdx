| **Mark-Price Construction** | **Mark Price** = median(P¹, P², 5-min_Last), Where: • Price 1 = Index Price × [1 + Last Funding Rate × (Time Until Funding /8)] • Price 2 = Index Price + Moving Average (5-minute Basis) • 5-min_last = Moving Average [(Bid1 + Ask1)/2 − Index Price], which measures every second in a 5-minute interval • Price-protection for Index Price: omit prints > 5 % from median; readmit after ≤ 3 % for 5 min. |
| **Price Formation when the underlying equity market is closed** | • **Equity leg (QQQ):** When NYSE Arca and all extended‑hours sessions are shut, the QQQ reference is **frozen at the last official consolidated close/auction print.** • **BTC leg:** The BTC component keeps streaming in real time via the 3‑venue, 4‑hour VWAP composite (Binance BTC/USDT, Bybit BTC/USDT, Coinbase BTC/USD). • **Internal liquidity:** Outside U.S. equity hours, all price discovery occurs on Roxom's own 24/7 order book. Market‑makers quote around the static QQQ close and the live BTC feed, so trading, funding and liquidations continue seamlessly. • **Mark Price:** mark price is calculated in the same way a the normal trading hours, where each _P_ is computed with the **static QQQ close** for the equity leg and the **live BTC composite** for the crypto leg. |
