  the opportunity for further gains as the closure is involuntary though
  rules-based & transparent.

A trader who is auto-deleveraged will immediately receive a notification from the platform that their position (or part of it) was reduced due to ADL. The details will include how much of the position was closed and at what price. Importantly, the affected trader **realizes the profit** on the portion of the position that was closed â€“ they are not losing money out of pocket, they simply don't get to continue holding that portion for potentially more gain. However, they do lose the opportunity to ride the position further, since it's been cut. The process is involuntary but rules-based and transparent. Roxom makes sure that traders can see exactly what happened and why.
