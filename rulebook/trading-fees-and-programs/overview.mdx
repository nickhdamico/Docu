* Roxom operates a seven-tier VIP fee structure based on 30-day trading volume measured in BTC, ranging from Standard (0-25 BTC) to Whale (500+ BTC) with progressively lower maker and taker fees to incentivize volume growth and liquidity provision.
* **VIP Classification:** Your VIP level is determined by your total trading volume over the last 30 days, with all volumes calculated in BTC. Funding fees received or paid do not count toward trading volume calculations.
* **Fee Structure:** Market makers who provide liquidity to the order book pay lower maker fees, while market takers who consume liquidity pay higher taker fees. Trading fees are calculated as Order Value × Trading Fee Rate, where Order Value equals Quantity × Executed Price. Fees are deducted from your account balance without affecting order margins, and all fee history is available in your trading records.
* The structure rewards high-volume traders with significant fee reductions, offering zero maker fees for Whale-tier derivatives traders (500+ BTC monthly volume) to attract serious market makers and institutional participants.
