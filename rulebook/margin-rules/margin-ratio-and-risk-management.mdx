# Margin Ratio & Risk Management

Margin Ratio helps traders analyze liquidation risk as Maintenance Margin requirement divided by Account Equity, with warnings at ~80% and automatic liquidation triggered at 100%.

## Understanding Margin Ratio

The Margin Ratio is a critical risk metric that shows how close your account is to liquidation. It's calculated as:

**Margin Ratio = Maintenance Margin Requirement รท Account Equity ร 100%**

### Key Components:
- **Maintenance Margin Requirement**: The minimum collateral needed to keep positions open
- **Account Equity**: Your total account value including unrealized P&L
- **Margin Ratio Percentage**: Shows your current risk level

## Risk Level Indicators

### Warning Zone (~80% - 99%)
- **Status**: High risk warning activated
- **Actions**: Consider reducing positions or adding collateral
- **Risk Level**: High - approaching liquidation threshold

## Best Practices for Risk Management

### Monitoring Your Margin Ratio
1. **Regular Checks**: Monitor margin ratio throughout trading sessions
2. **Set Personal Limits**: Consider taking action well before 80% threshold
3. **Understand Volatility**: Higher volatility increases liquidation risk

### Managing Risk Exposure
1. **Position Sizing**: Use appropriate position sizes for your account
2. **Diversification**: Spread risk across multiple positions when possible
3. **Stop Losses**: Implement stop-loss orders for additional protection
4. **Collateral Management**: Maintain adequate collateral buffers

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Add Collateral**: Deposit additional BTC to improve margin ratio
2. **Reduce Positions**: Close or reduce existing positions
3. **Hedge Positions**: Consider opening offsetting positions
4. **Monitor Mark Price**: Understand how mark price affects your calculations
