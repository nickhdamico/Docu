  The engine prevents self-trading by automatically canceling the older resting
  order when opposing orders from the same account would match, avoiding wash
  trades.

The engine automatically prevents self-trading. If two opposing orders from the same account would trade with each other, the system cancels the older order (the one resting on the book) instead of executing a trade. This avoids any accidental **wash trades** and ensures reported trade volume reflects genuine trades between different parties.
