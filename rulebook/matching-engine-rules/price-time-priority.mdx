title: "Price-Time Priority"
description: >-
  Roxom's matching engine uses price-time priority, where orders execute by best
  price first, then by timestamp, with pre-closure orders maintaining their
  original priority after market reopens.

Roxom's matching engine operates on a first-come, first-served basis for orders at the same price. Orders are matched by best price; if multiple orders share that price, the oldest (earliest in time) gets priority in execution. Price-time priority is upheld during normal trading; even after a trading halt or closure, orders that were in the book before a closure retain their priority when the market reopens
