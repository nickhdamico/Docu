### **Quote Currency**

Prices are quoted in BTC terms (e.g., an asset price might be shown as 0.0025 BTC). For convenience, the UI may also display this as satoshis (e.g., 250,000 sats).

### **Settlement Currency**

All profits, losses, and collateral are denominated in BTC (settlements are in BTC).

### **Contract Unit**

Each contract represents a fixed quantity of the underlying asset (e.g., GOLD/BTC has its own contract size, measured in ounces of gold).
