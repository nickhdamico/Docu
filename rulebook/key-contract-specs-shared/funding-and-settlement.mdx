title: "Funding & Settlement"
description: >-
  Periodic funding aligns perpetual prices with their underlyings, P&L accrues
  & settles at the Mark Price on close, & any liquidation shortfall is
  covered by the Insurance Fund (& ADL if needed).

### **Funding Interval**

Funding payments between long and short position holders occur at regular intervals specific to each contract (_see_ [_Funding Payments_](../funding-payments) _section for details_). Each contract's funding rate reflects the market's supply/demand imbalance for that asset, and the interval timing (e.g. 8h, 4h, 1h) is defined in the contract specifications.

### **Settlement**

As perpetual contracts, there is **no expiration date** and no final settlement. Unrealized P\&L continuously accrues based on the Mark Price and is realized when positions are closed. Funding payments serve as a mechanism to continually settle deviations between the contract price and the underlying price. If a position is liquidated, it is immediately closed out at market; any loss beyond the trader's collateral is handled by the Insurance Fund (and ultimately ADL if necessary).
