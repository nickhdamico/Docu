### **Order Types**

The various instructions for trades, including Limit, Market, Stop-Limit, and Stop-Market orders _(detailed in_ [_Order Types & Excecution Rules_](../order-types-and-execution-rules)_)._

### **Matching Engine**

Roxom's trade-matching system that executes orders based on price-time priority during live trading hours. It enforces all trading rules and risk checks described in this rulebook.

### **Auto-Deleveraging (ADL)**

A last-resort loss-distribution mechanism that automatically deleverages (reduces) opposing traders' positions to cover unallocated losses in extreme scenarios where the Insurance Fund is insufficient. ADL ensures the exchange as a whole remains solvent by sharing losses among profitable traders _(see_ [_Auto-Deleveraging section_](../auto-deleveraging-adl) _for detailed information about our system)._
