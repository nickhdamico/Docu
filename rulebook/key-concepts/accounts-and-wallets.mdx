# Accounts & Wallets

### Funding Account

The default user wallet on Roxom where all deposits are credited and from which withdrawals are processed. The Funding Account is separate from the trading account and is not used directly for trading or margin calculations. Users must transfer BTC from their Funding Account into their trading account to serve as collateral for positions.

### UTA Account

An all-in-one trading account structure that consolidates a user's balances and collateral across all product types on Roxom's platform. Under Roxom's UTA, a single BTC-denominated account is used for all trading activities. Every position opened from a UTA is margin-isolated by defaultâ€”i.e., the BTC you assign to a new position is ring-fenced and cannot be used to support other positions. Cross-margin mode will be introduced in a later release; until then, think of the UTA as an isolated-margin engine for all live trading products.
