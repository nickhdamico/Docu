title: "Trading Hours Logic"
description: >-
  Roxom's system enables both 24/7 contracts & market-hours contracts with
  schedules aligned to underlying assets.

Roxom's trading platform operates on a clear weekly schedule designed to align with traditional market hours for relevant assets. The trading hours depend on the instrument being traded. 24/7 contracts (like GOLD/BTC, US500/BTC, OIL/BTC, US100/BTC) trade continuously with no scheduled downtime. Market-hours contracts have defined trading sessions and daily closures aligned with their underlying markets.

During global weekday cash‑market hours, equity‑linked contracts align naturally with their listed venues; outside those hours, if they are 24/7 contracts, they continue to trade on Roxom around a static cash‑close price versus live BTC. This structure ensures round‑the‑clock liquidity while preserving clear reference pricing for risk management.
