  Liquidation triggers when Margin Ratio hits 100%, meaning account equity

  absorb further losses.

If a position's losses become too large relative to its collateral, Roxom's liquidation engine will intervene to close the position and protect the account from going negative.

When an account's **Margin Ratio reaches 100%** (meaning account equity equals the maintenance margin requirement for the position), that position is flagged for liquidation. In simpler terms, the account has no more free margin â€“ any further loss would start eating into collateral it doesn't have. At this point, a liquidation sequence is initiated to close the position before the account balance goes below zero.
