## 1. Definitions

**Available:** Assets that are available to the user and can be used immediately.

**Leverage:** The use of debt or borrowed capital to increase potential investment returns, amplifying both gains and losses.

**Base:** In a trading pair, the first asset (e.g., BTC in BTC/USDT). Its value is always equal to 1, and the quotation shows how many units of the second asset are needed to acquire one unit of the first.

**Buy:** A purchase order for a given pair. In BTC/USDT, a buy order acquires BTC in exchange for delivering USDT.

**Cancelled:** Order status when the user cancels it before execution; applies to unfilled limit orders.

**Cash In:** Inflow of digital assets into an account as a result of deposits, transfers, sales, or investments.

**Cash Out:** Outflow of digital assets from an account through withdrawals, payments, transfers, or purchases.

**OTP Key (One‑Time Password):** A temporary, single‑use access code generated for secure authentication and valid for a limited time.

**Access Credentials:** A unique set of data used to authenticate and verify a user's identity when accessing a system.

**Crypto‑assets:** Digital assets based on blockchain technology, including cryptocurrencies, tokens, and other digital financial instruments.

**Cryptocurrencies:** Decentralized digital currencies used as a medium of exchange and store of value.

**Derivatives:** Financial instruments whose value is based on the price of an underlying digital asset, including:  
 (i) **Perpetual Futures:** Contracts obliging the parties to buy or sell an underlying digital asset at a previously agreed price, but without a specific date.  
 (ii) **Options:** Contracts granting the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying digital asset at a specific price before or on a given date.

**Dust:** Fractional remainders resulting from transactions; these small values are automatically returned to the user.

**Filled:** An order executed completely under the terms set by the user.

**Frozen:** Assets temporarily unavailable for trading due to pending orders, court garnishments, suspected fraud, or other reasons.

**Funding Rates:** Periodic payments between perpetual‑futures traders to keep the contract price close to the market (spot) price. Traders in long positions pay shorts when the contract price is above spot, and vice versa.

**Limit Order:** Allows the user to set a specific price to buy or sell an asset; such orders remain in the order book until the market reaches the indicated price.

**Maker:** User who places an order in the order book that adds liquidity to the market, generally through Limit Orders.

**Market Order:** Order that is executed immediately at the best price available in the market. It includes a maximum permitted slippage of 2% and a fail‑over mechanism to source external liquidity if necessary.

**Order:** Instruction to execute a trade (pending or active).

**Partially Cancelled:** Status of an order that is cancelled after being partially executed. Applies only to limit orders.

**Partially Filled:** Order that is executed in part because there is limited liquidity at the set price.

**Website:** Official Company website: https://roxom.com.

**Passkey:** Password‑less authentication system based on biometrics or secure devices.

**Position:** Result of an already executed order that represents market exposure.

**Quote:** In a trading pair, the second asset (e.g., USDT in BTC/USDT). Its value indicates how many units of the quote asset are needed to buy one unit of the base asset.

**Roxom Terminal:** Platform showing the status of open positions and orders.
