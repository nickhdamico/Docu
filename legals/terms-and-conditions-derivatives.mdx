## 2. Account Opening

2.1. To open an Account on the Platform, the User must provide, under oath, all requested information truthfully, accurately, and completely.

2.2. The User undertakes to keep all requested information up to date and will be solely liable for any damage caused by failure to do so. Each User may hold only one Account on the Platform.

2.3. The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his/her access credentials. Any activity carried out from the Account will be deemed to have been performed by the User.

2.4. The User accesses the Account by entering his/her e‑mail address and generating a passkey that enables password‑less authentication using biometrics or a secure device to verify identity. To configure a passkey and/or log in from a new device, the User must generate a login OTP Key via the registered e‑mail. The User is obliged to keep the login OTP confidential; it will be sent to the registered e‑mail at the User's request. Consequently, the User is solely and exclusively responsible for all operations carried out in the Account. The User undertakes to notify immediately and by reliable means of any unauthorized use of the Account, as well as any access or attempted access by unauthorized third parties.

2.5. If the User has login difficulties, he/she must send an e‑mail from the address used to register to help@roxom.com.

2.6. The Company adopts reasonable measures to protect the security of information and the digital assets in custody. However, it shall not be liable for losses arising from external attacks, security breaches not attributable to the Company, or any other circumstance beyond its control, provided the Company has implemented reasonable and industry‑standard security controls.

2.7. The Company will never ask the User for confidential information such as passwords through unofficial channels.

2.8. When the User is a Legal Entity, it represents and warrants that the individual completing the account opening process on its behalf (hereinafter, the "Authorized Representative") has sufficient legal authority to bind the entity to these T&C and to operations on the Platform. The Authorized Representative shall be responsible for maintaining the accuracy and validity of the corporate documentation submitted during the identity verification process (KYB). The Company may request, at any time, additional documentation to verify such authority and representation.

2.9. **Notification of Structural Changes:** When the User is a Legal Entity, it agrees to notify Roxom Markets of any relevant structural changes within a maximum period of ten (10) business days from the date such change becomes effective. Structural changes shall include, without limitation:
- (i) Changes in the shareholding structure or equity participation
- (ii) Changes in legal representatives, directors, or officers
- (iii) Replacement of the Authorized Representative
- (iv) Changes to the registered address or operational headquarters
- (v) Mergers, spin-offs, dissolutions, or corporate transformations
- (vi) Modification of ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs)
- (vii) Any other change affecting the entity's identity, control, representation, or legal capacity

Failure to comply with this obligation may result in the temporary suspension or termination of access to the Platform, without prejudice to any other measures Roxom Markets may deem necessary for regulatory compliance.

## 3. Internationally Restricted Jurisdictions

3.1. There are countries in which, due to international restrictions or commercial decisions, account opening is not available. Regarding commercial decisions, the Company will determine in which jurisdictions it may provide the Services. Under the Company's policies, the following jurisdictions are restricted from using the services: United States, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, China, Russia.

3.2. The foregoing are considered by the Company to be jurisdictions in which it reserves the right to render its services, either because they are high‑risk or because they have weak measures for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing (AML/CFT/CPF) or because they have strategic AML/CFT/CPF deficiencies under international or local standards.

The Company reserves the right to reject the registration of a new Account for persons whose nationality or citizenship is U.S., U.S. Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico, or for those who, without being citizens or natives, reside in those countries.

The Company reserves the right to refuse the registration of a new Account at its sole discretion and/or under applicable regulations.

## 4. Use of the Platform Services

4.1. The Company allows users to open an account on its platform, accessible exclusively through the Company's website. By creating an account, the User may access the following services:
- a) Custody and Exchange of Bitcoin (BTC) and other Digital Assets
- b) Trading of Synthetic Derivatives (Options and Futures)

4.2. The provision of these services is structured based on the coexistence of two legally independent agreements between the User and the Company:
- **Mandate Agreement**, through which the User instructs the Company to execute operations on their behalf, including trading and derivatives transactions; and
- **Deposit (Custody) Agreement**, through which the Company commits to securely safeguard the User's digital assets.

4.3. As part of the contractual relationship between the User and the Company, the opening and use of the Account implies not only authorization to execute transactions (mandate), but also the deposit and safekeeping of the User's digital assets in wallets enabled by the Company (custody). The latter activity generates operational costs related to the security, maintenance, and management of such assets, even when the User is not actively operating.

In this regard, and with the aim of encouraging active use of the Platform, the Company shall fully waive the custody fee while both agreements — the Mandate and the Deposit — remain in force and active. This waiver is granted automatically and will remain in effect as long as the User maintains a complete contractual relationship with the Company.

If the Mandate Agreement is terminated, whether by the User or the Company, the waiver shall cease to apply, and a custody fee will begin to be charged on the remaining balance held in the Account.

4.4. The purpose of this fee is to cover the operational and security costs associated with maintaining inactive balances. The amount and conditions of the fee shall be duly communicated to the User prior to its application and shall at all times comply with applicable regulations.

## 5. Custody and Exchange Services

5.1. The Company offers users a custody service for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto‑assets (including Cryptocurrencies, Tokens, and Stablecoins) through its platform. This service enables the User to securely safeguard BTC and crypto‑assets, make transfers, and manage digital assets from the account registered on the Platform. The crypto‑assets that may be bought or sold on the Platform are exhaustively listed there. The User understands and agrees that the Company merely offers the crypto‑asset buy‑sell service and has no influence over their value, volatility, or characteristics. At the Company's sole discretion, additional crypto‑assets may be added, or one or more of the currently supported assets may cease to be supported, if deemed appropriate. Under no circumstances is the Company obliged to add or cease supporting crypto‑assets other than the current ones.

5.2. The User will use the service to receive (cash in) and send (cash out) BTC and crypto‑assets:

### 5.2.1. Cash In

To receive BTC and crypto‑assets, the User must access the Platform account and copy the address data provided by the Company. The User is solely responsible for executing transfer instructions to credit BTC and crypto‑assets to that address. It is essential that the User carefully verify the wallet address and the network used for the transfer. The Company is not liable for address errors, incorrect network selection, or any loss of funds resulting from transfers made erroneously by the User.

### 5.2.2. Cash Out

To withdraw BTC and crypto‑assets, the User must access the Platform account and enter the destination address data. The User is solely responsible for executing transfer instructions to withdraw BTC and crypto‑assets from that address. It is essential that the User carefully verify the wallet address and the network used for the transfer. The Company is not liable for address errors, incorrect network selection, or any loss of funds resulting from transfers made erroneously by the User.

5.3. The User agrees that any transfer of BTC and crypto‑assets to the Platform wallet must bear network costs (fees), which will be determined by network conditions at the time of the transaction. These costs are non‑refundable and are exclusively the User's responsibility. Likewise, the User agrees that any transfer of BTC and crypto‑assets from the Platform wallet must bear the established commissions, which are variable and determined at the time of the transaction. These costs are non‑refundable and are exclusively the User's responsibility.

5.4. Once BTC and crypto‑assets are credited to the provided wallet, the User may issue transfer instructions directly from the Platform account. All transfer instructions are irreversible. The User is solely responsible for ensuring that transfer data, including destination address and network, are correct before issuing the instruction.

5.5. If the User requests the cancellation of an issued instruction, the Company does not guarantee that it will be possible to stop the transfer before execution. Once executed, the transaction cannot be reversed under any circumstance.

5.6. The Company recommends that the User take the necessary precautions when operating with BTC and confirm the details of all transactions before execution.

### 5.7. Limitation of Liability

5.7.1. The Company shall not be liable for losses resulting from cyber‑attacks, hacks, malware, or other illicit activities, provided that reasonable security measures in accordance with industry standards have been implemented.

5.7.2. The Company shall not be liable for losses arising from force‑majeure events such as blockchain‑network failures, power‑supply interruptions, natural disasters, political conflicts, or other events beyond its reasonable control.

5.7.3. **User error responsibility.** The User acknowledges that he/she is solely responsible for verifying the compatible networks for depositing crypto‑assets supported by the Platform and undertakes to bear the costs associated with such operations. The Company is not liable for transfers made via incorrect networks or unsupported crypto‑assets. The User understands and accepts that such operations may result in the loss of the crypto‑assets sent.

5.7.4. If the User mistakenly sends crypto‑assets that are not listed on the Platform or via an unsupported network, those assets will not be reflected in the account. The User acknowledges and agrees that the Company only provides services for the crypto‑assets specifically listed on the Platform and is under no obligation to accept unlisted assets or process operations related to them.

## 6. Synthetic Derivatives Trading (Options and Futures)

6.1. The Company provides users with access to a trading system for operating option contracts and perpetual‑futures contracts based on digital assets (digital‑asset derivatives). These option and perpetual‑futures contracts are synthetic digital‑asset instruments that allow users to speculate on the future price of certain digital assets without the need to hold the underlying asset directly.

6.2. The Company reserves the exclusive right to determine which digital assets will be available for trading in option and/or perpetual‑futures contracts, as well as to modify, remove, or include assets without prior notice. These contracts always settle in BTC, which acts as the settlement asset. The Company reserves the right to select which assets will be traded as derivative assets.

### 6.3. Options Trading

6.3.1. Options are financial contracts that grant the user the right, but not the obligation, to buy (Call) or sell (Put) an underlying crypto‑asset at a predetermined price ("Strike Price") on a specific date (Expiration Date).

6.3.2. The buyer or seller must pay a premium, which is the cost of the contract.

6.3.3. **Parties involved:**
- (i) The user buyer and the user seller respectively acquire the right
- (ii) The Company grants the right and assumes the obligation to perform the contract if the user chooses to exercise it
- (iii) The Company may also act as a direct counterparty in the option contract

When the Company acts as counterparty, it undertakes to fulfill the obligations arising from the exercise of the option in favor of the User Buyer.

When the Company acts only as intermediary, fulfillment of the option depends on the User Seller, the Company being responsible for providing the infrastructure and transparency of the operation.

6.3.4. **Contract execution:** The User may exercise the right only on the Expiration Date, which can be consulted before starting the operation.

6.3.5. The User Buyer must have sufficient funds to pay the premium when acquiring the option. The User Seller, if not the Company, must hold the underlying assets or sufficient funds for cash settlement, as applicable.

6.3.6. **Cash settlement:** Operations carried out through the platform are settled exclusively by differences, with no possibility of physical delivery of the underlying asset.

Settlement will be effected automatically by differences, meaning that if the buyer exercises the option, the counterparty will pay the buyer the positive difference between the Strike Price and the market price of the underlying asset at the time of exercise. Market price will be determined based on [agreed price source/reference] and credited automatically to the User's account. That price may come from the Platform's own internal liquidity or from data supplied by a reliable third party via an API. The Company will carefully select such data providers to ensure price accuracy and representativeness. In the case of a Put, the calculation of the difference will be inverted.

6.3.7. The User Buyer must pay the premium at the time of acquiring the option. This premium is non‑refundable unless the specific contract terms or applicable regulations provide otherwise.

6.3.8. If the user does not exercise the purchase or sale option, he/she will assume the total loss of the premium and will have no right to any refund of the premium paid.

### 6.4. Perpetual‑Futures Operations

6.4.1. A financial instrument with no expiration date that allows users to take long (buy) or short (sell) positions in underlying crypto‑assets, with continuous settlement based on market price.

6.4.2. **Underlying crypto‑asset:** The crypto‑asset on which the contract is based.

6.4.3. **Settlement price:** Reference price used to calculate profits and losses, determined by the market or the applicable price index.

6.4.4. **Long position (Buy):** The user speculates that the price of the underlying crypto‑asset will rise.

6.4.5. **Short position (Sell):** The user speculates that the price of the underlying crypto‑asset will fall.

6.4.6. **Opening conditions:** The user must have sufficient balance to cover the required initial margin. The minimum order size will be specified on the Platform. Execution will occur through the order book or linked spot market.

6.4.7. **Initial/Maintenance margin:** Minimum deposit required to open a position and required to keep the position open. If margin falls below this level, the position may be automatically liquidated.

6.4.8. **Cash settlement:** All positions are settled through cash payments based on the difference between the opening price and the closing price.

6.4.9. **Automatic liquidation:** Occurs when the user's balance falls below the maintenance margin. The system may automatically close the position to avoid further losses.

6.4.10. **Funding payments (Funding Rates)**

Funding Rates are applied periodically (every eight hours unless otherwise stipulated).
- **Users in Long positions:** Will pay the funding rate to users in Short positions when the contract price is above spot.
- **Users in Short positions:** Will receive the payment when the contract price is above spot, or pay it if the opposite occurs.

The amount will be automatically debited from or credited to the user's account.

6.4.11. **Closing positions:**

6.4.11.1. **At the User's discretion:** The user may close the position at any time through the available market.

6.4.11.2. **By Automatic Liquidation:** If the user's margin falls below the maintenance margin, the system will automatically close the position.

6.4.11.3. **Forced closure:** The platform reserves the right to close positions in cases of emergency maintenance, breach of trading rules, or extraordinary market circumstances.

### 6.5. Positions

6.5.1. **Opening long positions:** Users may speculate on price increases of the available derivative assets.

6.5.2. **Opening short positions:** Users may speculate on price decreases of the available derivative assets.

6.5.3. **Available orders:** Users may use market orders, limit orders, and advanced tools such as Stop‑Loss and Take‑Profit, as allowed by the platform and made available to the user.

6.6. The Company offers users different leverage levels for trading derivative contracts. The leverage levels available will be those indicated on the platform's official website at any given time. The Company reserves the right to modify leverage levels—reducing, enlarging, or restricting the maximum leverage available—without prior notice.

### 6.7. Order Placement

The operation of derivative contracts is based on an order‑matching system. This implies that:

6.7.1. **Execution condition:** Any buy (long) order issued by a user can be carried out only when there is an equivalent sell (short) order issued by another user, and vice versa. Matching ensures the balance necessary for proper market operation.

6.7.2. **Matching mechanism:** Order execution is performed through the platform, which automatically identifies and matches opposing orders from users. This process ensures market continuity and liquidity.

6.7.3. **Lack of Liquidity:** If no opposite orders are available on the internal market, the platform may seek additional liquidity through external providers. This mechanism ensures that orders can be executed, minimizing the risk of delays due to missing counterparties.

6.7.4. **Limitations:** If immediate matching cannot be guaranteed, the user's order will remain pending until it can be matched—either by internal orders or external‑provider liquidity—or be cancelled under the conditions set by the user, such as limit prices or time‑in‑force expirations.

6.7.5. **Order Limits and Forced Closures**

The Company may set maximum and minimum limits on open orders, contract size, or required margins. These limits are determined solely by the platform and may be adjusted periodically according to market conditions.

If an open order reaches insufficient‑margin levels due to market fluctuations, the platform will automatically liquidate that position to avoid a negative balance in the user's account. The liquidation price will be determined under the platform's internal rules, which rely on market‑price indices and liquidity conditions.

The Company is not liable for losses arising from automatic liquidations, leverage‑level changes, or the user's inability to monitor positions in real time.

### 6.8. Limitation of Liability

The Company acts solely as an intermediary to facilitate trade execution and does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, or continuity of the services offered.

The platform is not responsible for:
- Losses due to price fluctuations, automatic liquidations, or sudden market moves
- Technical errors, connectivity interruptions, or communication failures that may affect operations
- Changes in leverage conditions or in the assets available for trading

### 6.9. Derivatives Trading Rule Book

6.9.1. The User acknowledges that trading in derivative products is governed not only by these Terms and Conditions but also by the operational rules set forth in the Derivatives Rule Book, available at the following link: [https://rulebook.roxom.com/](https://rulebook.roxom.com/).

6.9.2. Roxom Markets reserves the right to amend the Rule Book, in whole or in part, at any time to reflect market changes, regulatory requirements, or operational adjustments. Such amendments shall become effective seven (7) days after their publication on the official website, unless otherwise specified. Publication alone shall be deemed sufficient notice to all Users.

6.9.3. In the event of any discrepancy between these Terms and Conditions and the Rule Book, the Rule Book shall prevail with respect to the trading of derivative products.

6.9.4. The Rule Book sets forth the execution conditions, available order types, matching engine logic, margining rules, settlement procedures, trading schedules, and other technical aspects related to the use of derivative instruments, spot products, or any other products enabled on the Platform. It also includes specific definitions and descriptions regarding the Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) process, the operation of Insurance Funds, and the Default Handling mechanisms applicable in cases of breach.

All such conditions are essential for the proper, transparent, and secure functioning of the Platform, and compliance therewith constitutes a mandatory requirement for participation in trading activities.

## 7. Fees

7.1. The following services offered through the Platform are subject to Fees:
- (i) Synthetic Derivatives Trading (Options and Futures)
- (ii) Crypto‑asset Cash Out

The percentage and/or amount of the fee charged by the Company will always be shown to the User on the Platform before each operation.

The Company will charge no fee for the Custody Service.

## 8. Deposits

8.1. The User acknowledges that he/she is solely responsible for verifying the networks available to deposit BTC through the Platform and for bearing any costs such operations may generate. The Company is not liable for transfers via incorrect networks or for Digital Assets that are not supported, and the User recognizes that such operations may result in the loss of the Digital Assets.

## 9. Risks Associated with Digital Assets

The User understands that investments in Crypto‑assets may involve greater risks than those associated with traditional investments. The Company provides no advice of any kind and will not be liable for losses caused by volatility or Crypto‑asset trading.

The Company makes a **Risk Notice** available to all users, designed to clearly and transparently explain the risks associated with operations on the platform. This document provides essential information on possible scenarios and situations that could affect investments made through our services.

## 10. Proper Use of the Account

10.1. The User will not use the Services for any illegal purpose and will not carry out any operations on the Platform that are contrary to morals, customs, or local or international regulations, or that are in any way linked to money‑laundering and asset‑laundering, terrorism financing, proliferation‑financing of weapons of mass destruction, human trafficking, arms trafficking, or activities intended to finance, participate in, or support any illegal activity.

10.2. In every case, the Account is personal, unique, and non‑transferable, assigned to a single User, and its sale, assignment, or transfer (including reputation) under any title is prohibited. The User may not permit or authorize third parties to use the Account.

10.3. If the Platform suffers an attack, interruption, outage, malfunction, or any situation that prevents normal operations for a certain period, the User understands and accepts that the Company may, within 48 hours, review operations conducted during that time and make the necessary adjustments. In particular, but not limited to, the Company may verify that operations during the outage were not disproportionate to market reality or contrary to good faith, morals, and fair commercial practice, and the User accepts that the Company may make the adjustments needed to correct such activity. Likewise, if the User detects operations with those characteristics, he/she may contact help@roxom.com to request the corresponding adjustment.

10.4. Any indication or suspicion—determined at our absolute discretion—of fraud, manipulation, or any other deceptive or fraudulent activity will render all operations and any gains or losses invalid. In such circumstances, we reserve the right to suspend (temporarily or permanently) the Account and cancel all operations.

10.5. When the Account is used by a Legal Entity, it shall be responsible to the Company for all operations carried out on the Platform by its Authorized User or any other authorized employee or agent, assuming all obligations arising from the T&C. The Legal Entity acknowledges that it must implement internal controls and reasonable security measures to prevent misuse of its Account.

## 11. Account Confidentiality and Security

The User undertakes to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all authentication methods and credentials that allow access to the Account, including User ID, any passwords, device‑unlock codes, and the passkey. The User recognizes that the passkey is not a static datum but a credential cryptographically linked to the device. Therefore, the User must protect physical and logical access to that device and the associated authentication factors (e.g., PIN, fingerprint, facial recognition) to prevent third parties from using the passkey to gain unauthorized access.

The User is solely and exclusively responsible for all operations carried out in the Account with his/her access data. The User agrees to notify the Company immediately, through the authorized channels, upon detecting or becoming aware of any unauthorized use of the Account, any access or attempted access by unauthorized third parties, and/or any other security breach.

Company staff will never ask the User to disclose passwords.

## 12. Suspension or Termination

12.1. The Company may cancel or suspend the User's Account in any of the following cases:
- (i) A report by the User of a security and/or confidentiality breach of the Account, as regulated in these T&C
- (ii) A court order or requirement of a competent authority
- (iii) Well‑founded suspicion of fraud, money‑laundering, terrorism financing, proliferation‑financing, or any illegal or prohibited use at the Company's sole discretion
- (iv) Failure to provide and/or falsification of the data, information, and/or documentation requested for opening and/or maintaining the Account
- (vi) Violation of these T&C and/or the Company's Privacy Policy
- (vii) At the Company's absolute discretion

In all cases, the Company assumes no liability and reserves the right to take appropriate legal action.

12.2. If an Account is suspended or cancelled, the Company will notify the User by e‑mail to the address registered with the Account. Upon suspension or cancellation, the User may issue no new instructions except those intended to withdraw holdings, bearing the costs of such transactions. If suspension or cancellation involves a retention order issued by a competent authority, the User may not withdraw holdings, and the Company is not liable for any damage or loss this situation may cause the User.

12.3. **Custody Fee Upon Mandate Termination**

In the event of termination of the Mandate Agreement, the Company shall retain custody of the remaining digital assets under the still-valid Deposit Agreement. In such cases, the discount previously granted under Clause 4.3 regarding the custody fee shall cease, and the fee established in this clause shall apply. The User acknowledges and agrees that the secure custody of digital assets entails operational costs that Roxom must cover. The User further acknowledges that such fee was previously discounted, and that this discount automatically terminates upon rescission of the Mandate Agreement.

12.3.1. **Notification period:** The Company shall notify the User of the termination of the Mandate Agreement and the existence of remaining assets in their Account. From the date of such notification, a sixty (60) calendar day period shall begin, after which the fee indicated herein shall apply.

12.3.2. **Commencement of fee charges:** Upon expiration of the notification period, Roxom shall begin applying a monthly custody fee, charged in Bitcoin (BTC), using the prevailing BTC/USD exchange rate at the time of charging. The fee shall be automatically deducted from the remaining BTC balance in the User's Account. If the available balance is less than the BTC equivalent of the fee, Roxom shall deduct the entire remaining balance, without generating a negative balance or creating any further obligations for the User.

12.3.3. If the User successfully completes the withdrawal process after the fee has begun to be charged, they may request a refund of up to a maximum of three (3) months of previously charged custody fees.

## 13. Account Closure at the User's Request

13.1. When the User requests closure of the Account—either through the Platform or via the authorized communication channels—the Account will be deactivated. The Account will be closed only if it holds no balance; otherwise, the User must first withdraw all assets and then request closure again.

A closure request cannot be processed if the Company receives a duly authenticated notice from a competent authority ordering a freeze or similar measure that restricts availability of the Account.

13.2. User information and records of Account transactions will remain for the entire lifetime of the Platform or for at least fifteen (15) consecutive years from the date of closure, or for as long as the Company deems that such data continue to be necessary or relevant for the purposes for which they were collected.

## 14. Intellectual Property

The contents of the Platform—together with the programs, databases, networks, and files that allow the User to access and use the Account—are the exclusive property of the Company and are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, and industrial‑design laws and international treaties. Any improper use or total or partial reproduction of such contents is prohibited unless expressly authorized in writing by the Company.

## 15. Limitation of Liability

15.1. The Company shall not be liable for damage or service interruption to the Platform caused by events external to the Company. Nor shall it be liable for damage or interruption caused by any computer virus, spyware, or other malware that may affect the User's computer or device, or by phishing, spoofing, or any other attack. If the User doubts the authenticity of a communication purporting to be from the Company, he/she must not accept it and must notify the Company through the authorized channels. The User must always access the Platform through the means indicated on the Company's official website.

15.2. The Company shall not be liable—nor deemed to be in breach of these T&C—for any failure or delay in fulfilling its obligations insofar as such failure or delay is related to situations beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation: force majeure; flood, fire, earthquake, or explosion; war, invasion, hostilities (whether or not war is declared), terrorism, piracy, or threats, cyber‑attacks, or other civil unrest; any statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments, court orders, or decrees; or the action of any nation or government, state, or other political subdivision, or any entity exercising legislative, regulatory, judicial, or administrative functions, including any governmental authority, agency, department, board, commission, or council.

15.3. Access to the Services may be partially or totally limited during periods of high demand, volatility, or increased volume. Consequently, certain limitations may arise, including the inability to issue Instructions, which may also lead to delays in the Company's user support. Under no circumstances will the Company be liable for any interruption, failure, or delay in accepting, executing, or canceling any Instruction, or for Platform stability, service interruptions, transaction‑processing delays, or delays in support responses due to such circumstances. Nonetheless, we commit to providing the highest availability possible.

15.4. Each User is responsible for all tax and/or legal obligations arising from operations carried out on the Platform, and the Company bears no responsibility for any User non‑compliance. The Company is not responsible for Users' fulfillment of tax obligations under current law or any other obligation arising from Platform use.

15.5. The User acknowledges that, when withdrawing a Digital Asset, he/she is aware of the risk of sending Digital Assets to an incorrect destination account, which may cause irreparable loss of those assets. The Company will not be liable in any such case.

15.6. The Company shall in no case be liable for loss of value, depreciation, or volatility of crypto‑assets held, traded, or deposited on the Platform, especially when such events result from **external factors** beyond the Company's control, including but not limited to: changes in market conditions, governmental regulations or legal restrictions, decisions by digital‑asset issuers, blockchain‑network failures, cyber‑attacks, or third‑party technological vulnerabilities.

15.7. The Company will not be liable for losses suffered by users resulting from lack of skill, inexperience, or insufficient knowledge in using complex financial products, including: leveraged operations entailing high risks that may result in losses exceeding invested capital; highly speculative derivative products subject to significant market fluctuations; and poor trading decisions, since the Company guarantees neither returns nor specific results and is not responsible for misguided or ill‑informed investment choices.

### 15.8. Right to Cancel Instructions and Orders

15.8.1. The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to cancel any instruction and/or order issued by the User in the following cases:

15.8.2. **Operational Failures:** When technical interruptions, operational errors, failures in internal or external systems, or any other circumstance prevent proper execution of the instruction and/or order.

15.8.3. **Insufficient Funds:** If the User does not have sufficient funds in the account to cover the financial requirements associated with the instruction and/or order, including but not limited to margins, transaction costs, or applicable fees.

15.8.4. **Regulatory Breach:** If the User's instruction and/or order contravenes legal or regulatory provisions, or the Company's internal policies applicable to the service.

15.8.5. **Suspicion of Fraudulent Activity:** If the instruction and/or order shows signs of fraud, market manipulation, money‑laundering, or any illicit activity.

15.8.6. **Price Incompatibility:** If the price specified in a transaction cannot find a reasonable counterparty in the market, or if there is a pricing mismatch due to high volatility.

15.8.7. **Force Majeure:** If execution of the instruction and/or order is impeded by force‑majeure events such as natural disasters, political conflicts, communication‑network interruptions, or any other situation beyond the Company's reasonable control.

15.8.8. **Issues with External Counterparties:** If liquidity providers, associated markets, or external intermediaries involved in executing the order experience operational interruptions or insolvency.

15.8.9. **Lack of Information or Incorrect Data:** If the User's instruction and/or order contains incomplete, erroneous, or ambiguous information that makes proper execution impossible.

15.8.10. **Internet or Price‑Feed Errors:** Internet‑connection errors, connectivity problems, and price‑feed delays may sometimes cause the prices displayed through the Platform to differ from actual market rates. The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to disallow abusive Arbitrage (the practice of exploiting pricing errors and/or trading at off‑market prices and/or taking advantage of Internet latency—commonly known as "arbitrage," "sniping," or "scalping," hereinafter collectively "Arbitrage") through or in connection with our Services; any Transaction based on price‑latency arbitrage opportunities may be revoked at our sole discretion without prior notice.

## 16. No Financial or Legal Advice

The Company provides no financial advice, investment recommendations, or legal assistance in connection with the Services. The Company may supply information about the price, range, and volatility of Digital Assets and events affecting their price, but such information must not be considered financial or investment advice and should not be interpreted as such. Any notification/e‑mail/push message/social‑media post is for informational purposes only. All operational decisions are the User's responsibility, and the Company will not be liable for any loss incurred. All users are encouraged to read the Risk Notice carefully.

## 17. External Links or Access to Third‑Party Applications

The Platform may contain links to third‑party websites or provide access to third‑party applications, which does not imply ownership, operation, or any relationship with the Company. Users must accept the third party's Terms and Conditions to access and use such third‑party services. Because the Company has no control over those sites or applications, it is not responsible for the content, materials, actions, or services they provide, nor for damages or losses suffered by Users through their use, whether caused directly or indirectly. The presence of links to other websites or applications does not imply any partnership, relationship, approval, or endorsement by the Company or its affiliates of the owners of such sites or content.

## 18. Death of the Account Holder

In the event of the User's death or supervening incapacity, heirs or legal representatives must present the documentation requested by the Company to gain access to the Account. Until the Company verifies the required documents, the Account will remain suspended. Once the requirements are satisfied, the Company will grant Account access to the authorized parties solely to withdraw the holdings recorded in the Account and to close it.

## 19. Supported Digital Assets

The Platform reserves, at its sole discretion, the right to admit new Digital Assets, establish operating rules, or take other actions. It is exclusively up to the Platform to determine which types of Digital Assets will be offered. Consequently, the Platform may, at its absolute discretion, add additional Digital Assets to those currently supported or cease supporting one or more of the currently offered assets.

## 20. Severability

If any term, clause, or provision of these T&C is deemed illegal, void, or unenforceable (in whole or in part), that term, clause, or provision will be severable from these T&C without affecting the validity or enforceability of any remaining part, which will remain in full force and effect.

## 21. Assignment

21.1. These T&C, the legal relationship, and the resulting rights and obligations, as well as any right arising over the User's Account, may not be assigned, sold, or transferred by any means or under any title to any other person.

21.2. If the Company undergoes an acquisition, merger, spin‑off, transformation, or sale with a third party outside or within its group, it reserves the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign these T&C and the legal relationship with the User, as well as User information, in full compliance with applicable personal‑data‑protection regulations.

## 22. Customer‑Service Channels and Means of Notice

All notices and communications made by the Company to the User are deemed valid and received when made through the Platform or by e‑mail to the addresses provided by the User.

Within the application, the User may select which notifications to receive; however, the User accepts that certain notifications, due to their importance and any potential change in operations, will be sent to the entire user base.

The User may contact the Company with queries, complaints, or claims via in‑app chat or by e‑mail at help@roxom.com.

## 23. User Information Channels

  - Telegram [https://t.me/Roxomse](https://t.me/Roxomse)

## 24. Contact with Company Personnel

The User acknowledges that any interaction with a Company employee is solely to provide adequate support for proper service use. Disclosing any such communication—whether via e‑mail, phone call, WhatsApp, Telegram, or similar—and any personal data of a Company employee is strictly prohibited; violation may result in account closure and legal action for damages.

Company staff will contact Users only through official channels published on the website and will never ask the User to disclose passwords. All communications must strictly comply with the User Communication Manual.

## 25. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law

The interpretation and scope of these T&C are governed by the laws of the Republic of El Salvador. Any dispute arising under these T&C or from the use and operation of the Platform shall—prior to judicial action—be submitted to **DIRECT NEGOTIATION** as follows: upon a controversy regarding interpretation or performance of these T&C, the parties shall endeavor to reach an amicable solution. The party seeking direct negotiation must send a written request to the other, specifying the dispute, appointing its negotiator, and requesting a date, place, and time to resolve it. The recipient must reply within ten (10) calendar days, specifying the date, place, and time; failure to reply constitutes a waiver of the direct‑negotiation stage. Direct negotiation shall last thirty (30) calendar days from the day after receipt of the request, unless the parties mutually agree in writing to modify that period.

If **DIRECT NEGOTIATION** is exhausted without agreement, the dispute shall be settled by Arbitration in Law administered by the Mediation and Arbitration Center of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of El Salvador, under its current procedural rules. The seat of the tribunal shall be San Salvador, Republic of El Salvador, and the arbitration language shall be Spanish.

This clause applies to any dispute between the User and Roxom Markets S.A. de C.V. relating to digital‑asset operations. Any dispute or claim concerning other operations must be directed to the entity responsible for providing that service.

## Annex I – Application Programming Interface

### 1. Acceptance of the API Terms

By using our Application Programming Interface ("API"), a service available through our Site, this API Annex applies in addition to our Terms and Conditions ("T&C") and forms part of the agreement between the User and Roxom Markets ("the Company").

By accepting the T&C and this Annex, the User declares that they have read and understood the content of this document, accepting all the terms and conditions that constitute a binding agreement between the User and the Company.

### 2. Risk Disclosure

This section provides basic information about trading through APIs. Using an API increases the risks associated with the security of your account and may lead to the compromise of your credentials and the loss of funds deposited in your Account. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in using an API.

Using an API will allow you to use, access, execute commands, queries, or requests in relation to your Account, by and on your behalf.

Before using an API, you must verify your identity by means of an API Key, which you must generate on our Site. The API Key represents, verifies, and authenticates your identity to us, and is composed of a public-private key pair.

Some third-party providers may request your API Key to offer complementary services. Sharing it is equivalent to handing over your access credentials. This will allow them to access all data in your Account and to issue instructions on your behalf. You must exercise extreme caution when verifying the reliability of third parties requesting your API Key.

APIs are subject to limitations, such as restrictions on sending or receiving data. In addition, their functions are limited by the available commands. APIs may also be poorly designed, suffer errors, or become compromised.

You must understand and review the API Documentation, which is published at the following link [https://docs.roxom.com/](https://docs.roxom.com/) and is updated regularly. Changes to limits, errors, commands, or their removal may affect API operation.

We may modify API Use without prior notice or updating the Documentation.

### 3. Definitions and Interpretation

Capitalized terms used in this Annex and not defined herein have the meaning assigned to them in the T&C:

- **"API"**: Application Programming Interface provided by the Company.
- **"API Client"**: any software, application, site, or system that accesses and uses the API on your behalf.
- **"API Key"**: unique identifier to authenticate a user, developer, or program to the API.
- **"API Limits"**: restrictions on commands (queries, submissions, etc.) to and from the API, detailed in the Documentation.
- **"API Documentation"**: technical documentation, usage specifications, call-volume limits, and other guidelines available on our developer site.
- **"Negative Conduct"**: as defined in Section 6.
- **"Service Data"**: any data or content obtained through use of the API.
- **"Unauthorized Code"**: any malicious or invalid code, virus, trojan, worm, logic bomb, routine, or component intended to access, delete, or damage software, hardware, or data.

### 4. Disclaimer

The APIs are provided "as is" and "as available." We do not warrant their accuracy, completeness, reliability, continuous availability, service level, timeliness, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

Therefore, we shall not be liable for losses, data inaccuracies, costs, or indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of revenue or profits arising from the use or inability to use the API, whether authorized or not.

The user understands and agrees that they are responsible for the acts or omissions of any third party or API Client that they authorize to use the API.

Providing APIs does not prevent us from:
- (i) developing our own products or services, even if they are similar to your API Client; or
- (ii) modifying the APIs or the forms of access to them at any time, without prior notice.

### 5. Grant of API License

Subject to the provisions concerning Negative Conduct, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license over the Company's intellectual property rights, during the term hereof, to use the APIs for development, testing, and operation purposes.

This license does **not** grant rights over:
- personal data accessed through the API, whether intentionally or accidentally; nor
- intellectual property contained in the content accessible via the API.

### 6. Negative Conduct

The User represents and warrants that their API Clients do not contain Unauthorized Code.

Neither the User nor their API Client may:
- interfere with the API or the servers supporting it;
- exploit or test vulnerabilities, inject malicious scripts, commands, queries, or Unauthorized Code;
- use the API in a manner that compromises the security of the services, the API, or the Service Data;
- interfere with, modify, or disable features, controls, or protection mechanisms;
- reverse engineer, decompile, or derive the source code of the API;
- replicate the Company's products or services or compete with its user experience;
- monitor API availability or performance for benchmarking purposes;
- repackage or resell the API or the Service Data;
- use the API to infringe intellectual property rights or violate applicable law;
- commercially exploit the API.

### 7. API and Service Data Use

The right of use is subject to additional terms and limitations published in the specific Documentation of each API. The API Key is the only means of verifying access. The user accepts the risks linked to sharing it, losing it, or giving it to third parties.

The user is responsible for its security, and we assume no responsibility for instructions issued by third parties using it.

The user undertakes to notify the Company immediately of any unauthorized use of their API Key.

The user agrees that the Company may monitor usage to improve the service, ensure compliance, or for security reasons, and may audit their usage to verify compliance or identify risks. In the event of any breach of this Annex and/or the T&C, the Company may revoke access without prior notice.

### 8. API Documentation

The Company reserves the right to modify the API Documentation at any time, without prior notice.

In case of conflict between the API Documentation and this Annex, the API Documentation shall prevail.

### 9. Indemnification

The User understands and agrees to indemnify for any liability, damage, or expense (including legal fees) arising from:
- any third-party claim related to the User's use of the APIs;
- failures, outages, or data loss related to the User's use of the APIs;
- infringement of third-party rights; or
- claims by third parties using an API Client or applications derived from API implementation.

All intellectual property rights in the APIs and their outputs belong to the Company. You may not assert them without prior written authorization.

### 10. Suspension or Termination of API Access

The Company may terminate or suspend access to the API for any reason and without prior notice, and the User must cease its use immediately.

The Company may notify relevant third parties of the termination of the right to use.
