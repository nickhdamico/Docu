## 1. INTRODUCTION

This Risk Notice (hereinafter, the "Notice"), together with the Terms and Conditions, the Privacy Policy and any other document mentioned in said instruments, is issued by Roxom Markets S.A. de C.V. ("Roxom" or the "Company"), a company incorporated and registered in El Salvador, registered in the Commercial Registry under number 58 of book 25, with Tax Identification Number (NIT) 0623-210524-104-6. Roxom is authorized by the Government of El Salvador to operate as a Bitcoin Service Provider, performing as Bitcoin Custodian, Digital Exchange, Digital Bitcoin Wallet and Payment Processor, under Registration Code 66bfcaee9c3ab49e3172c5a5. The Company is domiciled at Calle Cuscatlan 4312, Colonia Escalón, San Salvador, San Salvador Centro, San Salvador, El Salvador. Additionally, the Company has been authorized by the National Digital Assets Commission as a Digital Asset Service Provider under registration number **____**.

The defined terms in this document shall have the meaning established in the Terms and Conditions.

**IMPORTANT:** The risks described in this Notice do not constitute, nor intend to be, an exhaustive list of all possible risk factors. This Notice does not exempt the User from the responsibility of being informed and understanding the technological, economic, and legal nature of digital assets, nor from managing such risks based on their own understanding, including risks associated with the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.

By registering as an Account Holder and/or using the Services, the User expressly acknowledges, accepts, and assumes the risks listed below. Furthermore, the User exempts Roxom from any liability for losses or damages, direct or indirect, derived partially or totally from the occurrence of any of the risks described herein.

**Risk Management by the Company:** The Company acknowledges the existence of the stated risks and works, to the extent of its capabilities and based on its internal policies (particularly the POLICIES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DIFFERENT RISKS), on their evaluation, management, and mitigation. These actions seek to minimize the potential impact of such risks on its operations, although they do not guarantee their complete elimination.

## 2. SPECIFIC RISKS

### 2.1. Access Security Risk

There is a risk that unauthorized persons may access the User's login credentials, either through careless handling, forgetfulness, or breaches in the devices used to protect the account. This unauthorized access can result in economic losses or improper alteration of digital assets associated with the account.

### 2.2. Investment and Capital Loss Risk

Investing in digital assets involves a high degree of risk, including the possibility of losing a significant portion or even all of the invested capital. Cryptocurrencies are subject to extreme fluctuations in their value due to factors such as market supply and demand, regulatory changes, and external events. It is the User's responsibility to evaluate their capacity to assume these risks before investing.

### 2.3. Technological Risks and Software Vulnerabilities

The Services depend on technologies such as Blockchain and other distributed systems. Technical failures, software errors, or obsolescence of the underlying technology may adversely affect the functioning of the Services. Additionally, advances in cryptography or unexpected technical developments could compromise security mechanisms or network consensus, affecting the stability and reliability of digital assets.

### 2.4. Regulatory and Legal Risks

The innovative nature of blockchain technology may lead certain jurisdictions to adopt restrictive regulations or apply pre-existing laws unexpectedly. These regulatory changes could significantly impact the availability, functionality, or even the continuity of the Services offered, forcing the Company to modify, suspend, or terminate its operations in certain regions.

### 2.5. Regulatory Uncertainty and Government Actions

Changes in laws or regulatory approach in a jurisdiction may make the operation of the Services illegal or unfeasible in that region. This could result in the suspension or termination of Services in that jurisdiction, which could lead to the loss of access to the Account and associated digital assets.

### 2.6. Blockchain Mining Related Risks

Blockchain networks are vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as double-spending, mining power concentration, self-mining, and other technical manipulations. A successful attack could compromise transaction integrity and Service operability. The User must be aware that miners control the network and can make changes, updates, or even delete the blockchain at any time, potentially affecting digital assets. These actions could result in significant disruptions to transaction processing and validation. Users should understand that the decentralized nature of blockchain networks means there is no central authority to prevent or reverse such events.

### 2.7. Tax Risks and Tax Obligations

The tax treatment of digital assets varies by jurisdiction and may be subject to changes. It is the User's responsibility to consult with tax advisors to understand the potential tax implications related to the acquisition, storage, and use of cryptocurrencies, including income tax, transfer tax, value-added tax, among others. Failure to comply with these obligations could result in adverse consequences.

### 2.8. Operational Discontinuity Risk

Factors such as low adoption of Services, failures in strategic alliances, intellectual property disputes, or other unforeseen circumstances could lead to the dissolution of the Company or interruption of Services. In such cases, digital assets stored in the User's Account could be permanently lost or become unrecoverable.

### 2.9. Unforeseen and Uncertain Risks

Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are emerging systems that may face unanticipated risks due to their innovative nature. These risks may arise as unexpected combinations of the factors described herein or as completely new situations that have not been previously considered, which could adversely impact digital assets and Services.

### 2.10. Risk of Extreme Value Fluctuations

The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can experience drastic and unpredictable changes in short periods. These variations can generate both significant gains and considerable losses. Before trading cryptocurrencies, the User must carefully evaluate their tolerance for volatility and ability to assume these potential losses.

### 2.11. Project and Issuer Related Risk

Cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets are created and managed by teams or entities that may face operational, financial, or legal difficulties. Despite the comprehensive analysis conducted by the Company to include certain projects, there is a possibility that these may fail, be canceled, or face technical problems. This could result in the total or partial loss of value of such assets.

Furthermore, any cryptocurrency or virtual asset can be eliminated, lost, or used repeatedly. There is even a risk that it may partially or totally lose its value due to deviations in its operation, unexpected restorations, cyber attacks, or atypical transactions associated with the asset.
