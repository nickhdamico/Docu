- [Bitcoin Denomination & Contracts](https://rulebook.roxom.com/key-contract-specs-shared/bitcoin-denomination-and-contracts.md): Roxom perpetuals use BTC as both the quote and settlement currency.

- [Funding & Settlement](https://rulebook.roxom.com/key-contract-specs-shared/funding-and-settlement.md): Periodic funding aligns perpetual prices with their underlyings, P\&L accrues and settles at the Mark Price on close, and any liquidation shortfall is covered by the Insurance Fund (and ADL if needed).

- [Behavior During Closed Hours (For Closed-Hours Instruments)](https://rulebook.roxom.com/trading-hours/behavior-during-closed-hours-for-closed-hours-instruments.md): Market-hours contracts allow limit order matching during closure but block market orders; all resting orders stay active, stop orders trigger at reopening, and continuous matching resumes.
- [Reopening After Closure (For Closed-Hours Instruments)](https://rulebook.roxom.com/trading-hours/reopening-after-closure-for-closed-hours-instruments.md): When markets reopen, queued orders are matched based on new conditions, with pre-closure orders retaining their original priority over new orders at the same price.
- [Limit Order](https://rulebook.roxom.com/order-types-and-execution-rules/limit-order.md): Limit orders execute at a specified price or better and can be placed anytime, including during market closures, with queued orders entering the book when trading resumes.
- [Market Order](https://rulebook.roxom.com/order-types-and-execution-rules/market-order.md): Market orders execute immediately at best available prices during live trading hours only, with built-in slippage protection to prevent extreme price impact.
- [Stop-Market Order](https://rulebook.roxom.com/order-types-and-execution-rules/stop-market-order.md): Stop-market orders trigger into market orders when a stop price is reached, guaranteeing execution but not price, including during market gaps where fills may differ significantly from the stop level.
- [Stop-Limit Order](https://rulebook.roxom.com/order-types-and-execution-rules/stop-limit-order.md): Stop-limit orders trigger into limit orders when a stop price is reached, providing price control but potentially sacrificing execution if the market moves beyond the limit price.
- [Overview](https://rulebook.roxom.com/trading-fees-and-programs/overview.md): Roxom operates a tiered fee structure, featuring progressively lower maker/taker fees that incentivize volume growth, reward liquidity provision, and attract institutional traders.
- [Tiered Fee Table](https://rulebook.roxom.com/tiered-fee-table.md): The table below displays the base trading fee rates for derivatives products and the 30-day BTC volume criteria required for each VIP level.

- [Price-Time Priority](https://rulebook.roxom.com/matching-engine-rules/price-time-priority.md): Roxom's matching engine uses price-time priority, where orders execute by best price first, then by timestamp, with pre-closure orders maintaining their original priority after market reopens.
- [Order Matching Engine](https://rulebook.roxom.com/matching-engine-rules/order-matching-engine.md): Continuous order matching during active hours; closed sessions allow limit orders only; reopening triggers conditional orders first, then resumes full matching without auction.
- [Self-Trade Prevention](https://rulebook.roxom.com/matching-engine-rules/self-trade-prevention.md): The engine prevents self-trading by automatically canceling the older resting order when opposing orders from the same account would match, avoiding wash trades.
- [Initial & Maintenance Margin](https://rulebook.roxom.com/margin-rules/initial-and-maintenance-margin.md): Initial Margin is the collateral required to open a position, while Maintenance Margin is the minimum collateral required to keep a position open.
- [Margin Ratio & Risk Management](https://rulebook.roxom.com/margin-rules/margin-ratio-and-risk-management.md): Margin Ratio helps traders analyze liquidation risk as Maintenance Margin requirement divided by Account Equity, with warnings at ~80% and automatic liquidation triggered at 100%.
- [Isolated Margin Mode](https://rulebook.roxom.com/margin-rules/isolated-margin-mode.md): Isolated Margin allocates collateral per position, limiting maximum loss to the margin assigned to that specific position without affecting other positions or account funds.
- [Mark Price & P\&L Settlement](https://rulebook.roxom.com/margin-rules/mark-price-and-p-and-l-settlement.md): Margin calculations use Mark Price to prevent manipulation-driven liquidations, with unrealized P\&L accruing real-time but unavailable for withdrawal in isolated mode until position closure.
- [Funding Interval and Timing](https://rulebook.roxom.com/funding-payments/funding-interval-and-timing.md): Funding payments occur periodically and are debited/credited only for open positions. Frequency of the funding payment may vary by contract, with default being 8 hours.
- [Funding Rate Calculation](https://rulebook.roxom.com/funding-payments/funding-rate-calculation.md): Roxom's funding rate combines an interest component with the premium/discount between perpetual and index prices, capped at ±3% per interval to prevent extreme rates.
- [Funding Payment Calculation](https://rulebook.roxom.com/funding-payments/funding-payment-calculation.md): Funding payment is dependant on position notional value and funding rate, with longs paying shorts when funding is positive (perp above index) and shorts paying longs when negative (perp below index).
- [Liquidation Triggers & Overview](https://rulebook.roxom.com/liquidation-mechanics/liquidation-triggers-and-overview.md): Liquidation triggers when Margin Ratio hits 100%, meaning account equity equals maintenance margin requirement, indicating no remaining free margin to absorb further losses.
- [Liquidation Process Steps](https://rulebook.roxom.com/liquidation-mechanics/liquidation-process-steps.md): The liquidation engine cancels all open orders first to prevent position growth, then executes market orders either in TWAP or fully liquidating the position, depending on slippage assessement.
- [Execution Pricing & Bankruptcy](https://rulebook.roxom.com/liquidation-mechanics/execution-pricing-and-bankruptcy.md): Liquidation aims to close positions at or better than Bankruptcy Price. Better executions contribute to the Insurance Fund, while worse executions create shortfalls that the Insurance Fund covers.
- [Insurance Fund Overview](https://rulebook.roxom.com/insurance-fund/insurance-fund-overview.md): BTC-denominated Insurance Fund covers liquidation shortfalls when trader losses exceed collateral, protecting winning traders' full profits and preventing negative balances without socializing losses.
- [Insurance Fund Sources & Growth](https://rulebook.roxom.com/insurance-fund/insurance-fund-sources-and-growth.md): The Insurance Fund is funded through Roxom's initial capital seeding and liquidation gains, where any excess margin from positions closed better than bankruptcy price is transferred to the fund.
- [Insurance Fund Operations](https://rulebook.roxom.com/insurance-fund/insurance-fund-operations.md): The Insurance Fund covers shortfalls when liquidated accounts go negative, resetting trader balances to zero and ensuring winning traders receive full profits without socialized losses.
- [ADL Overview & Triggers](https://rulebook.roxom.com/auto-deleveraging-adl/adl-overview-and-triggers.md): Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) is Roxom's last-resort mechanism for extreme black swan scenarios where liquidation losses exceed or exhaust the Insurance Fund.
- [ADL Ranking Algorithm](https://rulebook.roxom.com/auto-deleveraging-adl/adl-ranking-algorithm.md): ADL selection uses a ranking system prioritizing traders with the highest unrealized profit percentage and highest leverage on the opposite side of the defaulting position.
- [ADL Execution Process](https://rulebook.roxom.com/auto-deleveraging-adl/adl-execution-process.md): ADL closes positions of the highest-ranked opposing traders in order, taking portions or full positions to cover the shortfall, continuing down the rank until the entire deficit is resolved.
- [Effect on Affected Traders](https://rulebook.roxom.com/auto-deleveraging-adl/effect-on-affected-traders.md): ADL-affected realize profit on the closed portion at market price, but lose the opportunity for further gains as the closure is involuntary though rules-based and transparent.
- [Pre-Trade Order Controls](https://rulebook.roxom.com/risk-controls/pre-trade-order-controls.md): Roxom employs comprehensive pre-trade and post-trade risk controls to maintain market integrity and protect traders from abnormal events.
- [Position & Open Interest Limits](https://rulebook.roxom.com/risk-controls/position-and-open-interest-limits.md): Roxom's Risk controls include total open interest cap triggering platform-wide reduce-only mode; individual position limits with individual reduce-only mode.
- [Circuit Breakers & Trading Halts](https://rulebook.roxom.com/risk-controls/circuit-breakers-and-trading-halts.md): Circuit breakers trigger market-wide trading halts for contracts with extreme price movements, pausing trade execution while keeping the order book active for cancellations and new orders.
- [Post-Trade Risk Management](https://rulebook.roxom.com/risk-controls/post-trade-risk-management.md)
