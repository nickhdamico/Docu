## Overview

WebSocket connection management is fundamental to accessing Roxom's real-time data streams. This section covers connection establishment, authentication, heartbeat management, and reconnection strategies.

## Quick Start

### Basic Public Connection
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.roxom.com/ws');

ws.onopen = function(event) {
  console.log('Connected to Roxom WebSocket API');
};

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Received:', data);
};
```

### Authenticated Private Connection
```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now().toString();
const signature = generateHMACSignature(apiSecret, timestamp);

const ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.roxom.com/ws', [], {
  headers: {
    'X-API-KEY': 'your-api-key',
    'X-API-TIMESTAMP': timestamp,
    'X-API-SIGN': signature
  }
});
```

## Connection Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Environment Setup">
  Configure your environment variables and connection URLs for production or sandbox.
</Step>

<Step title="Establish Connection">
  Connect to the appropriate WebSocket endpoint with or without authentication headers.
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Connection Events">
  Implement event handlers for open, message, close, and error events.
</Step>

<Step title="Implement Heartbeat">
  Set up ping/pong mechanism to maintain connection health.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Reconnection Logic">
  Implement exponential backoff reconnection strategy for reliability.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Pooling">
    - Use a single WebSocket connection per application
    - Avoid creating multiple connections unnecessarily
    - Share connections across different parts of your application
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resource Management">
    - Always close connections when shutting down
    - Clear intervals and timeouts properly
    - Handle memory leaks from event listeners
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    - Implement robust error handling for all connection states
    - Log connection events for debugging
    - Monitor connection status metrics
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

After establishing a connection, you can:

- Subscribe to [Market Data](/reference/websockets/market-data) streams for real-time quotes and trades
- Enable [Account Updates](/reference/websockets/account-updates) for order and balance notifications
- Review [Authentication](/reference/authentication) requirements for private data access
