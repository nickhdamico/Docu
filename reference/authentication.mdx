## Overview

All Roxom API endpoints require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the request headers to access protected resources.

<Note>
Currently, only the `X-API-Key` header is enforced by the server. Timestamp/signature headers are accepted but not validated yet. HMAC verification is coming soon.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Authentication Method

Roxom uses **API Key** authentication. Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of your requests.

### Request Headers

```http
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.roxom.com/api/v1/accounts/balance" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-API-Key': 'your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.roxom.com/api/v1/accounts/balance', headers=headers)
```

```javascript
const headers = {
  'X-API-Key': 'your_api_key_here',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

fetch('https://api.roxom.com/api/v1/accounts/balance', { headers })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you will receive one of the following error responses:

### Missing Authorization Header

```json
{
  "error": 401,
  "message": "Authorization header is required"
}
```

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "error": 401,
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

### Expired API Key

```json
{
  "error": 401,
  "message": "API key has expired"
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Store API Keys Securely">
    Follow these security practices for API key management:
    
    - **Use environment variables** to store API keys
    - **Never commit API keys** to version control systems
    - **Use different API keys** for different environments (development, staging, production)
    - **Rotate API keys regularly** as part of your security policy
    - **Restrict API key access** to only necessary team members
    
    <Warning>
    Compromised API keys can lead to unauthorized trading activity. Treat them like passwords.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle Authentication Errors">
    Implement robust error handling for authentication failures:
    
    - **Implement proper error handling** for 401 responses
    - **Log authentication failures** for security monitoring
    - **Have a strategy for API key rotation** and seamless updates
    - **Set up alerts** for repeated authentication failures
    - **Implement retry logic** with exponential backoff
    
    <Tip>
    Store backup API keys securely to minimize downtime during key rotation.
